## The Math

A brief description of the mathematical concepts or modes of thinking that you have drawn upon in your submission.

A short but thorough explanation of your submission. What is the mathematical "point" of your submission? How does it illustrate the mathematical concepts you describe in an engaging way? Who do you envision the target audience to be?
